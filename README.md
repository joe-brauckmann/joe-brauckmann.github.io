_* - Recipe Calls for **Condensed** French Onion Soup but any of the options we found for this include soybean oil. As a substitute we get regular frech onion soup from progressive and only use about half of the brother included in the can_

**Beef Tips**
1. Depending on whether you bought already cut beef tips or top sirloin steak, you may or may not need to slice them in the beef tips shape. Then season them with salt and pepper, add them to a deep pot with the 2 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat (Or beef tallow for the chads out there) where they can cook until browned. Remove beef onto separate plate.
2. Next, you will chop the whole onion (or less depending on how badly you want your breath to stink) and add that to the pot that the beef was cooked in. Cook for about 10 min or until onion is softened.
3. Then comes the rest. Add  the beef broth, condensed soup, steak sauce, bay leaf, and beef back in all at once. Bring to boil, cover reduce heat to simmer and let hit for 1.5-2 hours.
4. Lastly when the meat seems tender and its smelling really good, you will mix ~3 Tbsp of flour with 1 cup of water for a thickening agent. Add this to the pot and mix in to give the sauce a gravy texture. Let sit for 5 more minutes and then you are ready to go!

**Rice**

Easy and straightforward. 1 Cup of rice, 2 cups of water. Add salt and a wee bit of olive oil. Bring to a boil, then let simmer for about 12 min or until the rice seems that it soaked all of the water. Timing this to match with the main course is something that comes with time.

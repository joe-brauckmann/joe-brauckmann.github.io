_* - Honestly, it's a salad. Make it however you want, these are just the things I had on hand. Next time I'll probably add cucumbers and carrots too._ 

**Pittsburgh Salad**
1. Make Your French Fries: Slice russet potatoes into long thing strips. Soak in water for an hour. Pat dry with paper towels. Preheat air fryer to 375. Coat strips with EVOO, salt, pepper. When ready, bake in the air fryer at 375 for 15 minutes, flipping halfway through. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat oven to 200. French Fries in the air fryer will take multiple batches, so throw the finished ones in the oven to keep warm while the others are frying. It probably would have been smarter to have just baked all of them in the oven together. 
2. Hard boil your eggs (ideally while the fries are being made)
3. Make Your Salad: self explanatory. Chop up whatever veggies you're using. Toss them in a large bowl with your chosen lettuce.
4. Slice or chop your hard boiled eggs and add them to a separate, small bowl. 
5. Cook Chicken: Ideally, the chicken is supposed to be grilled. If you don't have one of those or don't feel like it, cut the chicken into cubes. Add whatever seasoning you want and cook all the way through. Once finished and cooled a little, add the chicken bites to your salad & mix those guys in.
6. Grab your (warm) fries out of the oven.
7. Make Your Plate!: The Pittsburgh Way to build your plate is salad first, then egg whites, fries, shredded cheese, and dressing. We used Primal Kitchen Cilantro Lime marinade/dressing and highly recommend. 


NOTE* Grilled chicken is definitely way better for this, but it's still yummy however you can make it

# August 3 2022 - Beef Tips over rice

**Ingredients**

| Ingredient                   | Measurements    |
| ---------------------------  | --------------- |
| Top Sirloin Steak            | 2 lb            |
| Extra Virgin Olive Oil       | 2 tblsp         | 
| Onion                        | Chopped         | 
| Beef Broth                   | 10.5 oz         | 
| French Onion Soup*           | 10.5 oz         | 
| Primal Kitchen Steak Sauce   | 1 Tbsp          | 
| 1 Bay Leaf                   | -               | 
| Flour                        | 3 Tbsp          | 
| Water (For Flour)            | 1/3 Cup         | 
| Rice                         | 1 Cup           | 
| Water (For Rice              | 2 Cup           | 

_* - Recipe Calls for **Condensed** French Onion Soup but any of the options we found for this include soybean oil. As a substitute we get regular frech onion soup from progressive and only use about half of the brother included in the can_

**Beef Tips**
1. Depending on whether you bought already cut beef tips or top sirloin steak, you may or may not need to slice them in the beef tips shape. Then season them with salt and pepper, add them to a deep pot with the 2 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat (Or beef tallow for the chads out there) where they can cook until browned. Remove beef onto separate plate.
2. Next, you will chop the whole onion (or less depending on how badly you want your breath to stink) and add that to the pot that the beef was cooked in. Cook for about 10 min or until onion is softened.
3. Then comes the rest. Add  the beef broth, condensed soup, steak sauce, bay leaf, and beef back in all at once. Bring to boil, cover reduce heat to simmer and let hit for 1.5-2 hours.
4. Lastly when the meat seems tender and its smelling really good, you will mix ~3 Tbsp of flour with 1 cup of water for a thickening agent. Add this to the pot and mix in to give the sauce a gravy texture. Let sit for 5 more minutes and then you are ready to go!

**Rice**

Easy and straightforward. 1 Cup of rice, 2 cups of water. Add salt and a wee bit of olive oil. Bring to a boil, then let simmer for about 12 min or until the rice seems that it soaked all of the water. Timing this to match with the main course is something that comes with time.
